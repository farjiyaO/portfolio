### The Processes of creating web portfolio
---
This website's creation process was tough and fascinating all at once. The entire endeavour had many ups and downs,beginning with the prototype's development. It was quite challenging to create the full website layout using Bootstrap. The key challenge was determining the layout's component placement and structure andÂ the extra paddings. However, I was able to correct issues with a little research and advice from my professor. Using the Chrome Dev tool was truly life-saving and greatly assisted in solving numerous problems. Finally, improving the overall site quality was very helpful by employing several tests including the HTML, CSS validator, dead link checker, and WAVE tool.
