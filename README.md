### The Processes of creating web portfolio
 The Processes of creating this website was both challenging and interesting at the same time. Starting from creating the prototype to finish the entire project there were lots of up and down. Specifically, creating the entire website layout using bootstarp was really a journey. From figureing  component structure and position in the layout  and the extra padding on  top of the nav-bar it was a bumpy ride. But The amount of knowledge i gained from the research and trial and error to create the final product was worth it.
