                            FarjiyaTech was founded in 2022 by Farjiya, an Algonquin College graduate in Interactive
                            Media Design. The company was established with the goal of helping
                            businesses establish a strong online presence and leverage the power of digital marketing.
                            Farjiya's passion for digital media started early on, and she pursued her interests by
                            studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. During her studies, she gained
                            valuable experience in website design, UX design, and digital marketing. She recognized the
                            potential of these areas and decided to turn her passion into a career.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After graduating from Algonquin College, Farjiya founded FarjiyaTech to help businesses
                            harness the power of digital media. The company started with just a few clients, but it
                            quickly grew as Farjiya's reputation for high-quality work spread.

                            to create unique and effective solutions for their clients, ranging from small startups to

                            <p>
                                Farjiya is an immigrant from Bangladesh who came to Canada with a dream of becoming a
                                web developer. She was determined to pursue her passion for digital media and create
                                websites that are user-friendly, secure, and accessible by everyone.
                                Despite facing many challenges as an immigrant, Farjiya worked hard to achieve her
                                goals. She enrolled in Algonquin College's Interactive Media Design program, where she
                                gained valuable experience in website design, UX design, and digital marketing.

                                During her studies, Farjiya developed a deep understanding of the importance of putting
                                the client's needs first. She recognized that every business is unique and requires a
                                tailored solution that meets their specific needs. This led her to establish
                                FarjiyaTech, where she could provide high-quality web development and digital marketing
                                services that prioritize the client's needs and goals.

                                with her clients. That's why she ensures that her clients are involved in the
                                development process every step of the way, from the initial planning stages to the final
